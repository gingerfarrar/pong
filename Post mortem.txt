Post Mortem

	I feel i accomplished all my goals.
I didn't really have any plans at all.
i had a hard time with collision and
the background. But i had a fun time 
doing game states.
	i recieved help from esme and terry with 
collision and the background.
theres not much i would want to do different
i could have made wall ball i guess.
